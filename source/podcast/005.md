Take a listen to the first version of our thoughts on revision control.

### Overview

In this episode, we discuss revision control.  Revision control is a topic that is near and dear to both Chris and I and we’ve got some strong opinions on how it should be used.

(SPOILER ALERT: For lots of things!)

We cover what revision control is, why it matters, and what should be revision controlled.  We also talk a bit about how to deal with secrets or sensitive data that may need to pass through revision control.

We go on a bit of a tangent on why tooling that generates artifacts that can be revision controlled are preferable to tooling that is just “magic”.  That discussion is thanks to Chris digging up [this article](http://kief.com/infrastructure-as-code-versus-automation.html) on declarative configuration management versus VM templates.
