There is a certain irony in the fact that it has taken us long to get this episode up. Sadly, the Ops part of both mine and Steve’s life got a bit more hectic than expected. So here it is, with special guest, Tom Limoncelli, the author of Time Management for Systems Administrators and a co-author of The Practice of System and Network Administration. It was great having Tom on the show and I hope we can have more episodes like this in the future.
