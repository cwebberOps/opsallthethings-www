You may notice a bit of a gap in episode numbering… There is a show 013 out there, it was rather unlucky though so we are holding it back and may release it at some future point in time.

Since Chris and I haven’t talked much recently, we spent this show catching up on some industry changes.

We talk about:

* [Nano Server](http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowsserver/archive/2015/04/08/microsoft-announces-nano-server-for-modern-apps-and-cloud.aspx)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Chef Style DevOps](https://github.com/chef/devops-kungfu) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DEToXsgrPc))
* If you weren’t able to attend ChefConf, all the [videos are up](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11cZfNdwNyO9CpTWH2qjYfzysEtpfOCd).  And the PowerShell Summit NA was recently held and those [videos are online as well](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfeA8kIs7CochwcgX9zOWxh4IL3GoG05P).
