Dear listener,

Chris and I got back together to talk about the basic concepts around High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR). (And, no, High Availability is not being on-call in Colorado!) We cover some of the terminology used in the space, as well as some basic concepts and misconceptions.

This show was produced through the generosity of Chef.

— Steve
